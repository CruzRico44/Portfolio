			<h2>Streamlined Icon Generation</h2>
			<p>As a Technical Designer, a large part of my job is to design and implement tools that streamline art workflows.</p>
			<p>
			This mini-project allowed artists to automatically generate icons for hundreds of objects at the click of a button, saving countless hours of work for them, had they done each icon manually. It also
			 ensured consistency across icon renders, so we could achieve a uniform feel throughout the UI elements in question.
			</p>

			I would later automate the importing process as well, since batch importing was not supported in our engine.

<h2>Automated Avatar Rigging</h2>

This problem looked to tackle directly applying .fbx objects to the body parts of our characters in engine, and apply external data to the character rig in order to achieve a perfect 1:1 replacement.

<p>
Since engine didn't natively allow importing single .fbx character model and rigs, we needed a way to quickly export characters piecemeal and reconstruct them in engine, while retaining joint data.
</p>

<p>
My solution was to batch export character body parts as .fbx files (yet another process that I automated) and write their joint data to a JSON file. I then used an AutoIt script to automate clicks that imported each body part to its correct position, and applied the joint data from the .json file.
</p>

<p>
Again, this solution saved innumerable hours of rigging by hand, and allowed artists to see their rigged models in-engine extremely quickly, and allowed them to make changes as needed without wasting time.
</p>

<p>
An example of a character model that needed to have its body parts, as well as position, size, and joint data recorded and swapped with the default avatar's rig in engine:
</p>

<!---![Avatar that needed to be imported](https://github.com/cruzrico4/Tech-Design-Portfolio/blob/main/Projects/Automation/Media/NewAvatar.png =512x512)--->

<p>
The following gif shows the new model's .fbx body parts, position, scale, and joint data being updated automatically using AutoIt in lieu of built-in functionality:
</p>

<img src="./images/AvatarBuilder.gif" height="512px" />

<p>
And here's an image of a lineup of avatars that were able to be constructed and tweaked expediently thanks to these scripts:
</p>

<img src="./images/AvatarLineup.png" height="512px" />
<p>
This project allowed us to absolutely demolish the overhead required to see fully ingested characters in our engine, and streamlined the character creation process substantially.

		<h2>Illustrator Automation</h2>
		<p>
			I've also done projects to automate generating UI elements in Adobe Illustrator.
		</p>
		<p>
			We had reached the point in our project where we had a good amount of UI design work done, and needed to start creating button icons. 
			We had already made an icon set that we were happy with, but needed to take them through a stylization process to get them ready for ingestion.
		</p>
		<p>
			I noticed that the process was easily automated, so I got to work doing so, and this was the result:
		</p>
		<img src="./images/IllustratorAction.gif" height="512px"/>
		<p>
			In automating the process, I made what would have taken an afternoon of work for 3 UI artists doing around 100 icons into half an hour of work up front, and about 10 seconds of running each icon through the automation!

        My Experience in User/Human Centered Design
      </h1>
      <div>
        <p>
          I graduated from University of California San Diego in 2019 with a
          bachelor's degree in Cognitive Science with Specialization in Human
          Computer Interaction.
        </p>
        <p>
          That's a mouthfull, I know.
        </p>
        <p>
          My schoolwork largely involved working with other students to identify
          breakdowns that people encounter in their daily lives, and develop
          solutions to address those problems over the course of the class quarter.
        </p>
        <p>
          All of the solutions we developed were ideated from real world research
          of the actual people we were developing for. Much of our work used the
          concept of Human Centered Design; we would sit down with people, talk to
          them, and observe them working in the environments relevant to our projects
          in order to figure out a solution that worked best for them.
        </p>
        <p>
          We would then look over our data together and brainstorm ideas that could
          potentially address any breakdowns our people of interest were experiencing.
          These ideas then became prototypes, which we iterated repeatedly, constantly
          refining our product (which was sometimes software, a website, or a physical
          object) until we ended up with a final version that we were proud of and
          felt would best improve the lives of people we were designing for.

          The Takeaway

        <div>
          <p>
            Currently, the world is in need of more Human Centered Design. My mission
            is to find ways to make life better for everyone, and I want to find others
            who feel similarly. I strive to help make improvements on current designs
            and create new designs where they are needed to address the needs of
            as many stakeholders as possible. Everyone is important; everyone needs design.
